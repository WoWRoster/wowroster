5 - FAQ
======
Q. I'm not sure what I set SYNCHROURL and PRIMARYURL to in the Settings Management page.
A. SYNCHROURL is the URL path to the UniAdmin interface.php, eg. http://www.myserver.com/uniadmin/interface.php
   PRIMARYURL is the URL path to the upload page of the system you are sending data to, eg. for the WoW Roster
   it would be http://www.myserver.com/roster/update.php . For other systems, please check with the site
   owner or their on-line help for the appropriate URL.

Q. I'm still confused about the settings in the Settings Management page and how to configure them.
A. 1. First, hover your mouse over each setting, you'll get a tooltip with the corresponding part of the UniUploader interface
   2. If still confused, manually configure a copy of UniUploader with the settings needed for your config. Then open the
      settings.ini and you'll see all the settings just like in the Settings Management page. Copy the settings from the settings.ini
      into the appropriate fields in the Settings Management page.
