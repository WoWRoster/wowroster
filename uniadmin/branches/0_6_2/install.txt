UniAdmin 0.6.2 Beta (updated 9th August 2006)
===============================================

UniAdmin is a back-end web-based tool for managing the configuration of and logos in UniUploader and auto-updating WoW addons.

If you don't know what UniUploader is, then... well... you're a bit ahead of yourself then aren't you? ;-)

Requirements
============
- A web server (duh!)
- PHP 4.x or higher (http://www.php.net)
- MySQL Database (http://www.mysql.com)

Recommended
===========
- phpMyAdmin for loading .sql scripts (http://www.phpmyadmin.net)


INSTALLATION
============

1. Create a new database (eg. UniAdmin)
2. Create the tables and populate with default settings by running \sql\uniadmin.sql against the database created in Step 1.
3. Configure \html\config.php
4. Upload the contents of the \html\ folder
5. After FTPing, CHMOD the following folders to 0777, or change NTFS file permissions for these folders to make them available as "Everyone - Write" on a Windows machine.

[folders]
  addon_temp
  addon_zips
  logos

The 1 and only user in the users login table is:

Username - Default
Password - changeme

Read the help page once logged in for additional info.

UPGRADING
=========

1. Drop the tables for your old UA install.
2. Delete UA from your server completely.
3. Go to INSTALLATION

FAQ
===
Q. I'm not sure what I set SYNCHROURL and PRIMARYURL to in the Settings Management page.
A. SYNCHROURL is the URL path to the UniAdmin interface.php, eg. http://www.myserver.com/uniadmin/interface.php
   PRIMARYURL is the URL path to the upload page of the system you are sending data to, eg. for the WoW Roster
   it would be http://www.myserver.com/roster/admin/update.php . For other systems, please check with the site
   owner or their on-line help for the appropriate URL.

Q. I'm still confused about the settings in the Settings Management page and how to configure them.
A. 1. First, hover your mouse over each setting, you'll get a tooltip with the corresponding part of the UniUploader interface
   2. If still confused, manually configure a copy of UniUploader with the settings needed for your config. Then open the
      settings.ini and you'll see all the settings just like in the Settings Management page. Copy the settings from the settings.ini
      into the appropriate fields in the Settings Management page.
