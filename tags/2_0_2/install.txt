| Installation Overview |
-------------------------
* Make sure your web host supports MySQL and PHP
    o See Roster's Requirements [http://www.wowroster.net/MediaWiki/Roster:Requirements]
    o You'll need your login info to your MySQL and a database setup that Roster can use

* Download Roster and the Interface Imagepack [http://www.wowroster.net/Downloads/get=4.html]

* Decompress the downloads on your local machine, then upload the expanded files to your site
    o Most installs end up installing Roster in "www.[domain].com/roster"

* Browse to the roster installation, www.[domain].com/roster/
    o Follow on-screen instructions
    o Roster is now installed...

* Configure Roster by going to RosterCP and checking out all the settings
    o Check out the First Upload instructions for help [http://www.wowroster.net/MediaWiki/Roster:FirstUpload]

* Have members install CharacterProfiler (and optional PVPLog)
    o Deputize people you trust with the Roster Upload/Officer password to also run GuildProfiler
	o Profiler Add-ons can be downloaded here [http://www.wowroster.net/Downloads/c=3.html]

* Have everyone upload their data with regularity or look into using UniUploader, javaUniUploader, or phpUniUploader

| Hints                 |
-------------------------
* Do not simply upload the zip file to your provider
    You should unzip to your desktop then upload the contents of the archive, and make sure to keep
    the file and directory structure intact!

* Download the Interface Imagepack
    It's easiest to unzip the files on your desktop and figure out where they go after you've done that

* Make sure you get all the image packs
    Every time Blizzard creates new icons for items, talents, spells, etc... a new image pack is released
    For full functionality, be sure to have all current image packs installed
    We keep a full zip archive with the latest files, and some upgrade zip archives

* Configuring Roster (*ROSTERDIR*/?p=rostercp | *ROSTERDIR*/rostercp.html) - ACCESS VIA WEB!
    Check out the First Upload instructions for help [http://www.wowroster.net/MediaWiki/Roster:FirstUpload]

* Do not worry about GuildProfiler.lua
    There's nothing you need in there, either during installation or when updating information
    All the info you should care about is in CharacterProfiler.lua




-------------------------
| Installing Roster     |
-------------------------
Pre-install
  Create, or have ready a MySQL database that WoWRoster can use.
  It should already have a username and password assigned to it.


Step 1
  Making sure to keep the directory structure intact, move the unzipped files to a web-accessible directory.


Step 2
  All files and directories should be owned by your webserver's user/group
  (Example: chown apache.apache -R *).
  All .php files should be readable/executable

  $ chmod a+rx -R *.php


Step 3
  If you want the installation script to automatically set up your conf.php file for you, it should be readable/writeable
  Note: The installer will attempt to do this for you, but should an error occur, you may need to do this manually:

  $ chmod 666 conf.php


Step 4
  Browse to www.[domain].com/roster

  You should be presented with a page describing your server's settings and information.
  Once you are sure that your server meets WoWRoster's requirements, you can click the [Start Install] button.


Step 4-1
  * Database Host:
     Your MySQL server name.
     If it resides on the same server as the web server, you should enter 'localhost'
	 Some hosts may not have the mysql server on the same server as the web server,
	 so you should contact your host and get the correct server location

  * Database Name:
     The name of the database you created for WoWRoster, usually 'roster'.

  * Database Username:
     The username with permission to access the database.
     If you didn't create the database yourself, your host should have given you this information.

  * Database Password:
     The password used with the username from above.

  * Databse Prefix for Roster tables:
     Simply prefixes the name of each table that WoWRoster creates and uses.
     The default of 'roster_' should be sufficient for most installations.

  * Main Site URL:
     Should be detected automatically by the installation script, but if not just put the domain name of your server here
     ( ex: http://www.[domain].com )


Step 4-2
  * Administrator Password:
     A password of your choosing.
  * Administrator Password [ confirm ]:
     Simply re-type the password to verify it.
  * Note that the guild/user and officer/upload passwors will be set to this as well
    You can change them later via RosterCP


Step 5
     After you're satisfied with the values for the above fields, click the button to proceed.
     The installer will automatically fill your conf.php file.

     If the creation of conf.php failed, the installer will give you code to paste into conf.php.

     You will be notified if your passwords didn't match, and it will be reset to a default of "admin"
     You can change this later by going to RosterCP.

     This will also be the password for the Officer/Upload and Guild/User logins, change them via RosterCP

     Navigate to RosterCP, this is where you can configure all aspects of WoWRoster.
     After that, you're ready to begin using WoWRoster.

     You should now have a functional installation of WoWRoster.
     Remove the file install.php for extra security.




-------------------------
| Upgrading Roster      |
-------------------------
As always, we recommend a fresh install, in a clean folder, and a clean database.
But for those that absolutely need to upgrade, we have worked really hard for you on the upgrade script.


Special Instructions for lower than 2.0.0 to 2.0.x
  There is no upgrade path from versions lower than 2.0.0
  This is because Roster 2.0.0 gathers much more data from WoW than earlier versions and causes errors in the core files.


General Instructions

Step 1
  BACK UP YOUR DATABASE.

  This cannot be stressed enough.

  You should consider using phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net)
  This can use 'Completed Inserts' that will be necessary if you need to restore the database.


Step 2
  Seriously, go back up your database since you skipped step 1.


Step 3
  Back up your conf.php file.
  Usually we would never touch this file during an upgrade...but just in case something weird happens


Step 4
  Unzip the new WoWRoster version.
  Overwrite ALL files!
  It's best to delete everything in the roster folder EXCEPT! your conf.php file first, before copying over files


Step 5
  Access www.[domain].com/roster

  Select the version you're upgrading from.
  The script will perform all the necessary changes to upgrade from the version you selected to the newest version.


Step 6
  Navigate to RosterCP, this is where you can configure all aspects of WoWRoster.
  Remove the file install.php for extra security.




-------------------------
| Re-Installing Roster  |
-------------------------
Perhaps there has been some weird problem that you cannot solve
Such as database corruption, updating errors, data errors, etc...

You can try re-installing Roster


Pre re-install
  Make sure you have install.php in your roster folder on your web server


Step 1
  Delete conf.php from the roster directory


Step 2
  Drop all `roster_` tables in the database you created for Roster
  Note: `roster_` may be different if you changed the table prefix

  You can also just drop the database you created for Roster
  If you didn't create a new database for Roster, use the first method for removing the tables


Step 3
  Run install.php




-------------------------
| Un-Installing Roster  |
-------------------------
First of all, we'd like to thank you for trying our software and hope it was a good experiance for you
Sometimes Roster doesn't work on all servers although we try our best to improve this aspect


Step 1
  Remove/delete the roster directory from your webserver


Step 2
  Drop all `roster_` tables in the database you created for Roster
  Note: `roster_` may be different if you changed the table prefix

  You can also just drop the database you created for Roster
  If you didn't create a new database for Roster, use the first method for removing the tables
