--[ FIXES ]-------------------
  * Missing Poison profession icon added
  * Large amounts of display inconsistencies between IE6 and Firefox 1.0.6 fixed
  * Large numbers of formatting inconsistencies fixed

  * Inserted logic to account for Horde not getting a Searing Gorge key so it won't be displayed on Keys page
  * Fixed US server status page and implemented XML parser
  * Modified query to return character level as whichever is higher between members.level (data from GP) or players.level (data from CP) to solve problem of main view character level often being lower than the character pane level due to guild admins not doing GP updates frequently. Also modified the various display sort queries to suit change.

  * One less stylesheet, removed "css\styles3.css"

  * Keys page now includes Rogue Thieves' tools and partial quest completion gauges

The date/time format is configurable by the $phptimeformat variable.

------------------------------------
What's New v1.04 (July 30, 2005)
------------------------------------

--[ FIXES ]-------------------
  * Updated the $blizstatuspage variable in conf.php to fix issues since WoW 1.6.0 patch
  * Renamed "roster\CSS FILES" directory to "roster\css" to reduce issues with UNIX based web servers caused by spaces in the directory name.
  * Renamed "roster\CSS FILES\JV Scripts" directory to "roster\css\js" to reduce issues with UNIX based web servers caused by spaces in the directory name.
  * Deleted \roster\lib\wowdb.zip from distribution package - don't know why it's there in the first place...
  * Changed default UniUploader link in conf.php - existing link is broken
  * Changed default CharacterProfiler link in conf.php - existing link is to old non-working version
  * Cleaned up all files for spaces at end of files after PHP closing tag (can cause problems)
  * Fixed character link being invalid on the query return page of the "Find Team" page
  * Fixed "Find Team" queries returning no results (incorrectly) when the quest name contained an apostrophe
  * Included a MySQL 3.x compatible roster.sql called roster104_MySQL3.sql for creating database during installation (untested as I don't have a MySQL 3.x installation nor will I. This version is SO old there's no excuse for people to still be running it)
  * Main roster page version number use $version variable in conf.php rather than hard coded value in index.php page
  * Added slot_Waist.gif (missing) to /roster/img


--[ ENHANCEMENTS ]------------
  * Percentage value shown on the XP bar on the character page
  * Character gender now captured and displayed on the character page
  * Equipment slots not containing an item now show the same "greyed" icon as in-game rather than an empty slot on the character page
  * Smaller tab image used on bottom of character panel so they all fit on one row. This also creates room for more tabs... ;-)
  * Recipes now colour coded to reflect difficulty on recipes page
  * Generic Horde image now included for signatures
  * Additional quest lookup links now available on Quests page - Allakhazam and WWN Data added to existing Thottbot links
  * Quest lookup links now fully configurable via conf.php - show as many or as few as you like and add your own custom ones
  * Menu bar on top of most pages tidied up, dividers added, and now honors the individual On/Off flags in conf.php for whether they are displayed or not.
  * Added GZip support to updatemembers.php page for consistency with update.php - UniUploader users rejoice!
  * Included gd_info.php file to help troubleshooting issues with Signatures and the Server Status image. gd_info.php only shows the GD support info so is able to be safely link to publicly unlike phpinfo which gives away information which *could* be potentially be used maliciously.
  * Server Status image now able to be disabled via conf.php for those that do not want it displayed at all.
  * Various miscellaneous minor changes to main menu "box", including the guild character level breakdown info, and menu names.
  * Change variable declarations to be enclosed in ' rather than " if they don't contain variables (performance improvement - 'x' gets treated as a string and is assumed to not contain any variables and therefore doesn't get parsed which improves performance)
  * General code formatting cleanup, eg. remove large numbers of line spaces, correct formatting, replace multiple spaces with tabs, etc. on some files (there's still a LONG way to go!)
