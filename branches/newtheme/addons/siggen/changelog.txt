     This is still not completely fixed


01.26.2008 - v0.3.0.353

12.16.07 - v0.3.0.328

     + a=c: will still work, but member= overrides it
   o Changed: Saved images back to name@rc-realm.ext

11.28.07 - v0.3.0.320
 * Important Changes
   o Ported to Roster 2.0
   o Supports multi guild and public abilities in Roster
   o Accessing an image uses member= with either a member id, name, name@realm, or name@RC-realm
     + name= access is now gone for good. Don't bother me about it
   o Images for auto save are now saved as Charname@RC-Realm.ext (ext is the chosen image extention)
 * SigGen
   o Changed: SigGen display on character page now shows the url with the image extension when SEO mode is enabled in Roster
   o Changed: Removed av.php and sig.php, these are legacy files and are no longer needed
   o Fixed: Fixed "The install definition file for siggen did not contain a correct installation class"
 * SigGen Generator
   o Fixed: etag dating, I have no idea why db_ver was added to the date
   o Changed: Access to SigGen image generator now uses the roster addon framework
     + I may put back in direct access to siggen.php but for now you must use the framework
     + roster/index.php?p=util-siggen-signature&member=##
     + (SEO) roster/util/siggen/signature/member=##.ext
     + This also means the path access sig.php/Name.png does not currently work
   o Changed: SigGen now saves images based on member id, this is to resolve the accent problem
 * SigGen Config
   o Added: Clear Saved Directory setting
     + This will clear the save directory on a guild auto-save
   o Added: Added config to show different kinds of links on SigGen display page (default, force seo, saved)
   o Added: Clear saved directory setting, this will clear the save directory on a guild auto-save
   o Fixed: Settings Import will now show the correct error message instead of %1$s
   o Fixed: Updated some tooltips that haven't been updated in some time
   o Fixed: Notice error when no preview image is selected
   o Changed: Layout has been re-formated due to the layout in RosterCP
   o Changed: Settings Import will no longer reject older db exports, but it will reject newer ones
   o Changed: Removed the sql query window
   o Changed: Config Select will now show all available configs in the siggen table
     + In other words for those that figured out that multiple display designs can be made this way, all the configs will show in the config select box
   o Changed: Save directory replacement changes
     + %s% is now %s
     + %r% is now %r
     + Seems that encasing something in % makes it a wild card in SQL
   o Changed: Cleaned up functions class of all unused code and up to Roster Coding Standards
   o Changed: Now using addon.basename for part of the cookies used
   o Removed: Check for new version as Roster 2.0 does this now

      SigGen for WoWRosterDF MUST use member=
   o Fixed: av.php and sig.php now use full paths to siggen.php

      This will convert accented characters in a player's name to non accented characters when saving images

 * SigGen Config

    o Fixed: SigGen Update Service can now be turned of in conf.php
    o Fixed: frFR Error
    o Changed: Save images directory is now set full path

 * SigGen
    IT IS SUGGESTED TO START FRESH, I REALLY MEAN IT!
    Delete the entire SigGen folder, and drop the table `roster_addon_siggen`
    An upgrade is available, but not suggested

       Errors will now display as an image, so you do not have to right click on the image, and open in another window to see the error
       If there is a problem with the error image, it will default back to text mode
    o Changed: Improved the getEnglishValue() function some
       It will scan every main Roster locale installed

    o Uploading to Roster with UniUploader is still broken

       For now, these translation strings are built into "SigGen"
