Introduction
------------
	What is WoWRoster?

	WoWRoster is a profiler which retrieves and stores data gathered from WoW through the use of authorized addons
	(CharacterProfiler , GuildProfiler , and PvPLog)

	WoWRoster then organizes all of the data, provides a suite of presentations for the gathered data,
	and houses a base for addons to access and manipulate roster data, displays addon links in the Roster menu,
	and presents output to users.
