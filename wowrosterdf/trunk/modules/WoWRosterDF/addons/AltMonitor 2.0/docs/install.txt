NOTES:
-- Parses main/alt information from the public/officer note on guild updates
-- Determines a main and assigns all uploaded chars as alts of that character
   on character updates.
-- Also updates from existing guild member table when the appropriate 
   passworded button is pushed on the main/alt list page.


INSTALL:
1) Extract the AltMonitor archive to the roster/addons/ directory on your site.

2) Click the Alts/Mains link in the top of the site, and enter your roster
   password.

3) The addon installs automatically. 

4) Click the link to go to the AltMonitor configuration panel.

CONFIGURE:
1) Go to the AltMonitor configuration panel using the link at the bottom of the
   main/alt list.

2) Change any options you want. Use the buttons on the left side to see more
   options.

3) Use the reset button at the top of the config page to reset to the settings
   as they were when you loaded the page.

4) Use the save button at the top of the config page to save the changes.

UNINSTALL:
1) Click the uninstall link in the config page.

2) Click OK to confirm the uninstall.

3) Delete the AltMonitor folder from your webserver.

USE:
To generate the data just upload the guild member info with the 'run update
triggers on guild update' option enabled, or click the 'Update relations' button
in the config screen. In some cases you may need to do this twice, since an alt
isn't entered into the database if the corresponding main isn't in yet.
Unfortunately I don't get to pick the update order.

VERSION LOG:
2.0.1
-- Fixed the DOM (three identification bytes) in the top of localization.de.php
-- Updated some german strings with better translations. (thanks Lunzet)
-- Fixed a load of spelling errors in the french translation. (thanks Malkom)
-- Added a missing SQL change for 2.0.0

2.0.0
-- Fiddled around with the altlist indentation a bit
-- Cleaned up localization. It's in 1 file per language now, since organizing
   it like that makes it easier to keep the wordings in sync.
-- AltMonitor triggers no longer even attempt to run if its own tables
   aren't there.
-- Added an uninstaller. Basically it drops the tables.
-- Added a small change to the installer so it's possible to close the last
   statement with a ; now.
-- Added an option to switch between updating on guild updates, char updates,
   both, or neither.
-- Added a system that writes manual alt entries during character updates.
   This won't work before wow roster 1.7.3 because it uses the extra update
   hookpoints
-- Added some fixes from the main memberslist to altlist.php
-- Updated to use message_die rather than die_quietly for install/upgrade
   messages
-- Shortened update log output (only 1 line per character now)
-- Changed default sort to level then name

1.5.1
-- Fixed for L70

1.5.0
-- Added confirm dialogs to the config screen
-- Changed the debug mode. This now shows only the fields actually relevant if
   I need to debug something
-- SVN-versioned all files
-- Removed the guild info pull since that's pulled in Settings.php now
-- Removed the honour progress bar
-- Fixed the tooltips for mains/alts
-- Fixed a quoting error in the main/alt list

1.4.1
-- Removed the extra addslashes() for systems with magic quotes off since in
   Roster 1.7.1 this is done by settings already.
-- Removed some unneccesary code from the config library.

1.4.0
-- Roster 1.7.1 compatibility update for config screen
-- Now use the Roster Login class
-- Added support for putting the note as an icon on the right side of the table
-- Added a line to the tooltip if this is an alt, with the main name.
-- Put the update info in a box, like it is on the front page since this roster
   version

1.3.2
-- Forgot to do that debug mode fix. Done.

1.3.1
-- Added more indentation for alts because the buttons made them harder to 
   distinguish
-- Fixed an issue with database handling that should cause a warning but is
   ignored on some systems and fatal on others (guess which it was on mine).
-- Fixed the disappearing \ issue on systems with magic_quotes_gpc set off.

1.3.0
-- Turned the config.php into a library, should be usable by others too now.
-- Changed addon link format to use a action= parameter for page selection.
-- Added french localization by Harut.
-- Added german localization by Geschan and Sphinx

1.2.0
-- Fixed the occasional blue line in the update log.
-- The ugly box-button under the config page menu for updating relations is now
   a nice link in the rest of the list. Cheers to Zanix and Silencer-ch for
   helping me with the jscript involved.
-- Finally really fixed the initial regex setting. Appearantly I needed to
   accomodate 3 different spots (2 before entereing into the database, 1 after)
   where the backslashes got removed.
-- Some abstractizing of config.php to ease future introduction of it in a
   skeleton mod to be used as a base for other addon authors.
-- Fixed missing +/- problem. This occurred because there wasn't a main has
   alts check if a character was assigned main status because of an invalid
   main name.

1.1.3
-- Fixed error on SQL updates.

1.1.2
-- Fixed parsing errors when updating.

1.1.1
-- Fixed the config link in the bottom of the altlist.
-- Realized an earlier change in the fetching of the config idea wasn't as good
   as I initially thought; I reverted the change.

1.1.0
-- Fixed the displaying of an incorrect roster version on the AltMonitor config
   page
-- Changed the config page to use the addon framework.
-- Added a SQL update system. This will ask for a Roster password to update the
   AltMonitor database after each file update, to write the new version nr to
   DB and add/edit/change any other options that were changed in that update
-- Added debug switch to the alt list. Call up the addon list, then edit the
   url by appending &debug=true. It's meant for troubleshooting.
-- Added 2 buttons to open or close all alt rollouts. Anyone who knows a way to
   do this in JS is welcome.
-- Fixed the default regex. Forgot to escape the \ in the SQL. If you are
   updating you will have to change this value manually.

1.0.3
-- How'd that dot get there?

1.0.2
-- Fixed some includes that caused problems for some people.
-- I went over the code and changed something I shouldn't have. Fixed now.

1.0.1
-- Fixed a stupid bug with installing.

1.0.0
-- Now features an options screen where you can configure AltMonitor without
   manually editing and uploading php files.
-- Now features an automatic install procedure, no more manual SQL entering.
-- Compatible with Roster 1.7.0.

0.6.1
-- Fixed an issue with images not loading properly.
-- Added update info from main member list to the altlist one.
-- Removed modified main members list.
-- Added switch to show mainless alts in bottom rather than top.

0.6.0
-- Added the ability to fold in/out the alts in the altlist. 1 javascript file
   and 2 image files have been added for this.
-- Changed round the altlist code so you can have alt indenting in any sort.
   Still need to fix some ascending/descending stuff.

0.5.5
-- Added color coding to the main/alt update page. The red ones indicate
   whose public/officer notes need looking at.
-- Fixed a bug that would occur if you called altlist without specifying a
   collumn to sort on. This bug would also crop up if you specified an
   incorrect password to update the relations.
-- Turns out the previous fix didn't work on all setups. I'm forcing dutch
   locale for sting comparisons now since that makes it accept a lot of special
   characters correctly.

0.5.4
-- Switched to the other regex algorithm in php. This fixes the special
   character bug. However it also changes the syntax a bit; you should now
   add a / before and after a custom regex string.
-- Added some examples to the regex configuration.

0.5.3
-- Fixed alt of alt bug that basically blew up everything. Note to self: Start
   testing PROPERLY

0.5.2
-- Added and tested a routine to check for alts of alts.

0.5.1
-- Forgot to actually add the check if a main has alts

0.5.0
-- Partial rewrite of the addon to remove the dependancy on wowdb.php and the 
   roster_accounts table. Changes are in altlist.php and update.php

0.4.3
-- Replaced the short openign tag in the beginning of altlist.php with a normal
   one.
-- Removed quotes around the member ID in the first query in update.php. This
   caused errors with some MySQL versions, though not with mine.

0.4.2
-- Fixed a stupid semicolon bug that didn't show on my system.

0.4.1
-- Fixed SQL error in the members tables
-- Fixed wrong file inclusion on global update.

0.4.0
-- Added feature to declare a char as main when the regex didn't give a result
-- Added main/alt relation update button to the character list
-- Changed file structure, added some files.

0.3.3
-- Added the officer note as a valid choice for the main/alt indication.
   Another oversight of mine.

0.3.2
-- Added an additional check in 3 places in membersList.php if $ORDER_FIELD is
   an array. This worked before but produced a warning, which goes into the
   error log for me but appears on the screen for some people.

0.3.1
-- Fixed a syntax bug in the index.php

0.3
-- Added indent-style alt list display, and an option to switch between
   indent-style and divider-style.

0.2
-- Added Main/Alt display
-- Added patch instructions to allow this display in the main memberlist.
-- Reorganized files in the archive.

0.1
-- Initial beta release. Only updates members, does not display them yet.
