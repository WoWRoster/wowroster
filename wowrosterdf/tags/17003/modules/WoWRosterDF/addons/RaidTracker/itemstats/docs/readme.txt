==============
This is simply a re-make / edit of ItemStats v1.2.
Edits by: John Ohl - http://www.netwavehosting.com

Features:
- Item stats download from Allakhazam, including item set bonuses.
- Databased cached items to speed up the reload time of items, and make data easily accessible from multiple sources (EQdkp and phpBB installations can share data easily).
- Support for local or remote icon cache for items.
- Quick and easy to follow instructions on how to modify your EQdkp and phpBB installations.
- Minimal changes to the EQdkp and phpBB code for easy re-installation in case of upgrades.
- Easily change the look of your item display with the included stylesheet.
- Fairly clean, commented and modular code if you feel like making any changes, or are just curious on how things work.

EQdkp features:
- "mouseover" tooltips for icon and color coded item listing on the following pages: 'List Items', 'View Member', 'View Raid', 'View Event'.
- Display of item stats and links to info sites on the 'View Item' page
- New [item][/item] bbcode to the news page which creates item colored links to Allakhazam with mouse over tooltip.

phpBB features:
