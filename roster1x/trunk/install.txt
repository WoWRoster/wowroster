Installation:
-------------
Pre-install:
    Create, or have ready a MySQL database that WoWRoster can use.
    It should already have a username and password assigned to it.

Step 1:
    Making sure to keep the directory structure intact, move the
    unzipped files to a web-accessible directory.

Step 2:
    All files and directories should be owned by your webserver's user/group
    (Example: chown apache.apache -R *).  All .php files should be
    readable/executable

    $ chmod a+rx -R *.php

Step 3:
    If you want the installation script to automatically set up your conf.php file for
    you, it should be readable/writeable

    Note: The installer will attempt to do this for you, but should an error occurr,
    you may need to do this manually:

    $ chmod 666 conf.php

Step 4:
    Browse to http://www.yourserver.com/roster/install.php

    You should be presented with a page describing your server's settings and information.
    Once you are sure that your server meets WoWRoster's requirements, you can click the
    'Start Install' button.

    Step 4-1:
        Database Host:
            Your MySQL server name.
            If it resides on the same server as the web server, you should enter 'localhost'

        Database Name:
            The name of the database you created for WoWRoster, usually 'roster'.

        Database Username:
            The username with permission to access the database.
            If you didn't create the database yourself, your host should have given you this
            information.

        Database Password:
            The password used with the username from above.

        Databse Prefix for Roster tables:
            Simply prefixes the name of each table that WoWRoster creates and uses.
            The default of 'roster_' should be sufficient for most installations.

        Roster URL Path:
            Should be detected automatically by the installation script, but if not
            just enter the path following the domain name where the script is located.
            Examples:
            Full path to the install script      Enter this in "Roster URL Path"
             'http://mydomain.com/user/roster'    '/user/roster'
             'http://mydomain.com/roster'         '/roster'
             'http://mydomain.com'                ''

        Main Site URL:
            Should be detected automatically by the installation script, but if not
            just put the domain name of your server here (ex: mydomain.com, www.myhost.com)

    Step 4-2:
        Administrator Password:
            A password of your choosing.
        Administrator Password [ confirm ]:
            Simply re-type the password to verify it.


    After you're satisfied with the values for the above fields, click the button to proceed.
    The installer will automatically fill your conf.php file.

    If the creation of conf.php failed, the installer will give you the option to download
    this file, then you can upload it to your web server.

    You will be notified if your passwords didn't match, and it will be reset to a default of "admin"
    You can change this later by going to Roster Config.

    Navigate to Roster Config, this is where you can configure all aspects of WoWRoster.
    After that, you're ready to begin using WoWRoster.

You should now have a functional installation of WoWRoster.
Remove the files install.php, upgrade.php and the install/ folder for extra security.



Upgrading:
----------
As always, we recommend a fresh install, in a clean folder, and a clean database
But for those that absolutely need to upgrade, we have worked really hard for you
on the upgrade script.

If you encounter problems, post in our forums - http://www.wowroster.net
With as much information as you can give us


Step 1:
    BACK UP YOUR DATABASE.  This cannot be stressed enough.  You should consider using
    phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net) which can use Completed Inserts that will be
    necessary if you need to restore the database.

Step 2:
    Seriously, go back up your database since you skipped step 1.

Step 3:
    Back up your conf.php file.
    WoWRoster 1.7.0 DOES have a new conf.php file, so you should back it up!

Step 4:
    Unzip the new WoWRoster version.
    Overwrite ALL files!
    It's best to delete everything in the roster folder EXCEPT! your conf.php file.

Step 5:
    Access http://www.yourserver.com/roster/upgrade.php
    If you go to any other page, it WILL display "Detected Invalid Access..."
    YOU MUST go to http://www.yourserver.com/roster/upgrade.php
    Select the version you're upgrading from.
    The script will perform all the necessary changes to upgrade from the version you selected
    to the newest version.

Step 6:
    WoWRoster 1.7.0 uses a new conf.php file, it will automatically be upgraded for you.
    If this fails, the upgrader will give you the option to download this file,
    then you can upload it to your web server.

Remove the files install.php, upgrade.php and the install/ folder for extra security.

    Navigate to Roster Config, this is where you can configure all aspects of WoWRoster.
    You will need to visit this page as the upgrader only upgrade certain important fields
    from version 1.6.0


Configuration:
--------------
Once you've logged into Roster Config, your next step should be changing the configuration settings.

Most of the fields have descriptions where appropriate.

Have Fun!
