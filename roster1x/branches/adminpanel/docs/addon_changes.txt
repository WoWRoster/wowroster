These are the changes for the roster addon framework:

- All addons need to be installed. For an example of an 'empty' installer that
  only generates addon and menu table entries see the reputation addon.

- Serveral variables in addon.php, most notably $addonDir, have changed names.

- conf.php and localization.php are called from a function. All variables other
  $addon_conf and $wordings that need to be accessed should be accessed via
  $_GLOBALS.

- Configuration from database is automatically added. Addons are initialized in
  this order:

  * Addon registration record
  * Other constants (locations of addon files and the addon base dir)
  * Database configuration for the selected default profile.
  * Localization file
  * Config file


- The following data is in the addon registration record, stored in $addon.

	Array
	(
	    [addon_id] => 3
	    [basename] => recipe
	    [dbname] => recipe
	    [version] => 1.0.0
	    [hasconfig] => default
	    [active] => 1
	    [dir] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\
	    [index] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\index.php
	    [cssFile] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\default.css
	    [cssUrl] => /addons/recipe/default.css
	    [locale] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\localization.php
	    [conf] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\conf.php
	)

- basename is the name of the addon's install directory. dbname is the name it
  is installed under in the DB.

- The database config information is stored in $addon_conf[$addon['dbname']].

- The addon is called by addon.php using the 'dbname' GET parameter.

- You do not know the dbname at design time. Use the $addon['dbname'] variable
  for this at all times.

- On updates, the addon's trigger.php is only called once, after guild,
  character, and pvp updates have already ran. The addon is passed a $updateData
  array with all data uploaded in this update. This trigger file is called if
  at least 1 file the addon has registered for is in the upload.

- menu.php calls the localization file if you've got a registered, active menu
  button, but it doesn't call any of the other addon files or import the db config.
  The addon config panel calls the db config and the localization file, but
  currently not the addon's database record or config file.
