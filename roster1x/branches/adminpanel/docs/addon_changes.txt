These are the changes for the roster addon framework:

- All addons need to be installed. For an example of an 'empty' installer that
  only generates addon and menu table entries see the reputation addon.

- Serveral variables in addon.php, most notably $addonDir, have changed names.

- conf.php and localization.php are called from a function. All variables other
  $addon_conf and $wordings that need to be accessed should be accessed via
  $_GLOBALS.
  
- Configuration from database is automatically added. Addons are initialized in
  this order:
  
  * Addon registration record
  * Other constants (locations of important files and the addon base dir)
  * Database configuration for the selected default profile.
  * Localization file
  * Config file


- The following data is in the addon registration record, stored in $addon:

	Array
	(
	    [addon_id] => 3
	    [basename] => recipe
	    [dbname] => recipe
	    [version] => 1.0.0
	    [hasconfig] => default
	    [hastrigger] => 0
	    [active] => 1
	    [dir] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\
	    [index] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\index.php
	    [cssFile] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\default.css
	    [cssUrl] => /addons/recipe/default.css
	    [local] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\localization.php
	    [conf] => C:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs\RosterSVN\roster1x\branches\adminpanel\addons\recipe\conf.php
	)

- basename is the name of the addon's install directory. dbname is the name it
  is installed under in the DB.

- The addon is called by addon.php using the 'dbname' GET parameter.

- You do not know the dbname at design time. Use the $addon['dbname'] variable
  for this at all times.
