 *
 * "A module is a self-contained component of a system,
 * which has a well-defined interface to the other components;
 * something is modular if it includes or uses modules which can
 * be interchanged as units without disassembly of the module. Design,
 * manufacture, repair, etc. of the modules may be complex, but this
 * is not relevant; once the module exists, it can easily be
 * connected to or disconnected from the system."
