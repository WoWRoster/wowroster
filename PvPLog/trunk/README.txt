Installation:
    You should have just downloaded PvPLog.zip
    This file will unzip to:
        PvPLog/
        PvPLog/CHANGES.txt
        PvPLog/PvPLog.lua       
        PvPLog/PvPLog.toc       
        PvPLog/PvPLog.xml       
        PvPLog/README.txt
    Place the entire PvPLog directory in your 
    WoW/Interface/AddOns directory.

    
Use:
    PvPLog will automatically log your PvP wins and losses
    as well as your duel wins and losses.

    You can enable/disable PvPLog with:
        /pvplog enable
        /pvplog disable
    When disabled PvPLog will *not* track any of your PvP activites.

    When you win/lose a PvP battle, or duel, PvPLog will notify you
    as the data is recorded.
    
    Whenever you mouseover someone for which you have a PvP record
    the mouseover tool tip will contain the number of wins and
    losses you have against that player.  It will also produce an audible
    ding on mouseover to inform you of a player you have a record with.
    At this time a message is also displayed overhead with your record.

    When targetting a player you have a PvP record with, your record
    will be displayed below the target window.  This text is movable.
        /pvplog targetreset
            May be used to reset the text to its original position.


    You may get some basic statistics using:
        /pvplog stats


    You may get the version of PvPLog with:
        /pvplog version
    

    You may get the vendor tag of PvPLog with:
        /pvplog vendor
        

    You may reset your PvPLog settings using:
        /pvplog reset confirm
    Be careful as this will erase all your records!
