2) Go to the Roster Control Panel, manage addons, and click the MembersList
   installation icon.

3) The addon installs automatically.

4) Click the new MembersList button in the pagebar to configure MembersList.

CONFIGURE:
1) Go to the MembersList configuration panel using the link in the Roster Control
   Panel

2) Change any options you want. Use the buttons on the left side to see more
   options.

3) Use the reset button at the top of the config page to reset to the settings
   as they were when you loaded the page.

MEMBERSLIST VERSION LOG:
1.8.0-0
-- Merged AltMonitor, SortMembers, and the built-in memberslist and memberlog
   into a single roster addon
-- Roster 1.8.0 compatibility
-- Extra pages for all characters in a realm
-- Talent icons/specs column
-- Column show/hide configuration for all columns on all pages

ALTMONITOR VERSION LOG:
2.0.2
-- Removed php close tags in files that don't need them.
-- Fixed the update type setting to actually work.
-- Clarified update log a bit when the regex doesn't match.
-- Fixed debug mode.
-- Changed to use a roster JS function rather than its own to show/hide alts
-- Fixed an error that caused the spanish uninstalled wording to overwrite the
   english one.

2.0.1
-- Fixed the DOM (three identification bytes) in the top of localization.de.php
-- Updated some german strings with better translations. (thanks Lunzet)
-- Fixed a load of spelling errors in the french translation. (thanks Malkom)
-- Added a missing SQL change for 2.0.0

2.0.0
-- Fiddled around with the altlist indentation a bit
-- Cleaned up localization. It's in 1 file per language now, since organizing
   it like that makes it easier to keep the wordings in sync.
-- AltMonitor triggers no longer even attempt to run if its own tables
   aren't there.
-- Added an uninstaller. Basically it drops the tables.
-- Added a small change to the installer so it's possible to close the last
   statement with a ; now.
-- Added an option to switch between updating on guild updates, char updates,
   both, or neither.
-- Added a system that writes manual alt entries during character updates.
   This won't work before wow roster 1.7.3 because it uses the extra update
   hookpoints
-- Added some fixes from the main memberslist to altlist.php
-- Updated to use message_die rather than die_quietly for install/upgrade
   messages
-- Shortened update log output (only 1 line per character now)
-- Changed default sort to level then name

1.5.1
-- Fixed for L70

1.5.0
-- Added confirm dialogs to the config screen
-- Changed the debug mode. This now shows only the fields actually relevant if
   I need to debug something
-- SVN-versioned all files
-- Removed the guild info pull since that's pulled in Settings.php now
-- Removed the honour progress bar
-- Fixed the tooltips for mains/alts
-- Fixed a quoting error in the main/alt list

1.4.1
-- Removed the extra addslashes() for systems with magic quotes off since in
   Roster 1.7.1 this is done by settings already.
-- Removed some unneccesary code from the config library.

1.4.0
-- Roster 1.7.1 compatibility update for config screen
-- Now use the Roster Login class
-- Added support for putting the note as an icon on the right side of the table
-- Added a line to the tooltip if this is an alt, with the main name.
-- Put the update info in a box, like it is on the front page since this roster
   version

1.3.2
-- Forgot to do that debug mode fix. Done.

1.3.1
-- Added more indentation for alts because the buttons made them harder to
   distinguish
-- Fixed an issue with database handling that should cause a warning but is
   ignored on some systems and fatal on others (guess which it was on mine).
-- Fixed the disappearing \ issue on systems with magic_quotes_gpc set off.

1.3.0
-- Turned the config.php into a library, should be usable by others too now.
-- Changed addon link format to use a action= parameter for page selection.
-- Added french localization by Harut.
-- Added german localization by Geschan and Sphinx

1.2.0
-- Fixed the occasional blue line in the update log.
-- The ugly box-button under the config page menu for updating relations is now
   a nice link in the rest of the list. Cheers to Zanix and Silencer-ch for
   helping me with the jscript involved.
-- Finally really fixed the initial regex setting. Appearantly I needed to
   accomodate 3 different spots (2 before entereing into the database, 1 after)
   where the backslashes got removed.
-- Some abstractizing of config.php to ease future introduction of it in a
   skeleton mod to be used as a base for other addon authors.
-- Fixed missing +/- problem. This occurred because there wasn't a main has
   alts check if a character was assigned main status because of an invalid
   main name.

1.1.3
-- Fixed error on SQL updates.

1.1.2
-- Fixed parsing errors when updating.

1.1.1
-- Fixed the config link in the bottom of the altlist.
-- Realized an earlier change in the fetching of the config idea wasn't as good
   as I initially thought; I reverted the change.

1.1.0
-- Fixed the displaying of an incorrect roster version on the AltMonitor config
   page
-- Changed the config page to use the addon framework.
-- Added a SQL update system. This will ask for a Roster password to update the
   AltMonitor database after each file update, to write the new version nr to
   DB and add/edit/change any other options that were changed in that update
-- Added debug switch to the alt list. Call up the addon list, then edit the
   url by appending &debug=true. It's meant for troubleshooting.
-- Added 2 buttons to open or close all alt rollouts. Anyone who knows a way to
   do this in JS is welcome.
-- Fixed the default regex. Forgot to escape the \ in the SQL. If you are
   updating you will have to change this value manually.

1.0.3
-- How'd that dot get there?

1.0.2
-- Fixed some includes that caused problems for some people.
-- I went over the code and changed something I shouldn't have. Fixed now.

1.0.1
-- Fixed a stupid bug with installing.

1.0.0
-- Now features an options screen where you can configure AltMonitor without
   manually editing and uploading php files.
-- Now features an automatic install procedure, no more manual SQL entering.
-- Compatible with Roster 1.7.0.

0.6.1
-- Fixed an issue with images not loading properly.
-- Added update info from main member list to the altlist one.
-- Removed modified main members list.
-- Added switch to show mainless alts in bottom rather than top.

0.6.0
-- Added the ability to fold in/out the alts in the altlist. 1 javascript file
   and 2 image files have been added for this.
-- Changed round the altlist code so you can have alt indenting in any sort.
   Still need to fix some ascending/descending stuff.

0.5.5
-- Added color coding to the main/alt update page. The red ones indicate
   whose public/officer notes need looking at.
-- Fixed a bug that would occur if you called altlist without specifying a
   collumn to sort on. This bug would also crop up if you specified an
   incorrect password to update the relations.
-- Turns out the previous fix didn't work on all setups. I'm forcing dutch
   locale for sting comparisons now since that makes it accept a lot of special
   characters correctly.

0.5.4
-- Switched to the other regex algorithm in php. This fixes the special
   character bug. However it also changes the syntax a bit; you should now
   add a / before and after a custom regex string.
-- Added some examples to the regex configuration.

0.5.3
-- Fixed alt of alt bug that basically blew up everything. Note to self: Start
   testing PROPERLY

0.5.2
-- Added and tested a routine to check for alts of alts.

0.5.1
-- Forgot to actually add the check if a main has alts

0.5.0
-- Partial rewrite of the addon to remove the dependancy on wowdb.php and the
   roster_accounts table. Changes are in altlist.php and update.php

0.4.3
-- Replaced the short openign tag in the beginning of altlist.php with a normal
   one.
-- Removed quotes around the member ID in the first query in update.php. This
   caused errors with some MySQL versions, though not with mine.

0.4.2
-- Fixed a stupid semicolon bug that didn't show on my system.

0.4.1
-- Fixed SQL error in the members tables
-- Fixed wrong file inclusion on global update.

0.4.0
-- Added feature to declare a char as main when the regex didn't give a result
-- Added main/alt relation update button to the character list
-- Changed file structure, added some files.

0.3.3
-- Added the officer note as a valid choice for the main/alt indication.
   Another oversight of mine.

0.3.2
-- Added an additional check in 3 places in membersList.php if $ORDER_FIELD is
   an array. This worked before but produced a warning, which goes into the
   error log for me but appears on the screen for some people.

0.3.1
-- Fixed a syntax bug in the index.php

0.3
-- Added indent-style alt list display, and an option to switch between
   indent-style and divider-style.

0.2
-- Added Main/Alt display
-- Added patch instructions to allow this display in the main memberlist.
-- Reorganized files in the archive.

0.1
-- Initial beta release. Only updates members, does not display them yet.

SORTMEMBER VERSION LOG:
0.2.0
-- Inequality filters on date columns work in FF, work even better in Opera,
   and fail to work completely in IE. I'm not gonna fix this since it'd involve
   writing my own date parsing function, and there are limits.
-- Added inequality filtering. Currently supports <, >, <=, =<, >=, =>, == for
   number fields and == for string fields. Put the symbol at the beginning of
   the field.

0.1.0
-- Initial beta release.
-- Merged the AltMonitor framework with a couple of files from the roster 1x
   AdminPanel branch.

EDITING THE CODE
If you want to add more, similar member listings, or you want to change the
displays in the existing listings beyond what is possible from the config,
the following points are interesting:

- To create a new page, copy one of the existing pages to a new file.
  A file called mylist.php in one of these folders will be accessible like this:
  Directory	Scope name	Url (normal)				Url (alternate)
  /			Util		?p=util-memberslist-mylist	/util/memberslist/mylist.html
  /char/	Character	?p=char-memberslist-mylist	/char/memberslist/mylist.html
  /guild/	Guild		?p=guild-memberslist-mylist	/guild/memberslist/mylist.html
  /realm/	Realm		?p=realm-memberslist-mylist	/realm/memberslist/mylist.html

- The MOTD, honor/pvp overviews, and update info are all included from this
  list file.
- The query is fully defined in the list file, except for the order part.
  Delete the fields you don't use and add those you want to use additionally.
  Remember some of the fields are still used in the name popup.
- The columns are defined as elements of the FIELD array. This is the syntax:

$FIELD['name'] = array (
		// The FIELD key is the DB field to be displayed
	'lang_field' => 'name',
		// 'lang_field' is the localization key for the header. If the key
		// is invalid, it is printed in the header literally.
	'order' => array( '`members`.`name` ASC' ),
		// 'order' contains the SQL for an ascending sort
	'order_d' => array( '`members`.`name` DESC' ),
		// 'order_d' contains the SQL for a descending sort
	'value' => 'name_value',
		// 'value' is a callback to the function that draws this column. The
		// function should also be defined in the list file (except for the
		// name/class/level/honor value functions included in the lib).
		// It has two parameter, the DB row for the current player and the
		// db field name to be displayed.
	'js_type' => 'js_string',
		// 'js_type' is the field type for the javascript. There are currently
		// three supported values:
		// - 'js_string' for string sorting/filtering
		// - 'js_number' for numeric sorting/filtering, including inequalities.
		// - 'js_date' like js_number, but filter criteria are fed to Date.parse
		//		first. The value in the jsort property should be a unix timestamp
	'jsort' => 'name',
		// 'jsort' is the field the javascript (clientside sorting) should sort
		// and filter on. This can be omitted if it's the same as the display
		// field, and should never occur together with 'value'
	'display' => 3,
		// 'display' generally refers to a config field. It determines if the
		// column is visible:
		// - 0 for force hidden (not drawn/passed to the client)
		// - 1 for default hidden (can be made visible if clientside sorting is
		//     active)
		// - 2 for default shown (can be made invisible if clientside sorting
		//     is active)
		// - 3 for force shown (always shown and cannot be hidden using JS)
);
