NOTES:
-- Displays the main members list, but sortable and filterable using JS.

INSTALL:
1) Extract the SortMember archive to the roster/addons/ directory on your site.

2) Go to the Roster Control Panel, manage addons, and click the SortMember
   installation icon.

3) The addon installs automatically. 

4) Click the new SortMember button in the pagebar to configure SortMember.

CONFIGURE:
1) Go to the SortMember configuration panel using the link in the Roster Control
   Panel

2) Change any options you want. Use the buttons on the left side to see more
   options.

3) Use the reset button at the top of the config page to reset to the settings
   as they were when you loaded the page.

4) Use the save button at the top of the config page to save the changes.

UNINSTALL:
1) Click the uninstall link in the config page.

2) Click OK to confirm the uninstall.

3) Delete the SortMember folder from your webserver.

USE:
Click one of this addon's buttons in the menu to view the sortable list.
It may take a couple of seconds to sort the full list; sorting a filtered list
is faster.

VERSION LOG:
0.3.0
-- Roster 1.8 compatibility

0.2.0
-- Inequality filters on date columns work in FF, work even better in Opera,
   and fail to work completely in IE. I'm not gonna fix this since it'd involve
   writing my own date parsing function, and there are limits.
-- Added inequality filtering. Currently supports <, >, <=, =<, >=, =>, == for
   number fields and == for string fields. Put the symbol at the beginning of
   the field.

0.1.0
-- Initial beta release.
-- Merged the AltMonitor framework with a couple of files from the roster 1x
   AdminPanel branch.
